# Reasoning

**Evaluating citation formats**

I’m considering how to include citations properly. The web.run spec says I can’t use raw URLs unless the user asks, but I can use citation tokens that turn into links in the UI. The user requested citations using markdown links named by domain, which feels like a bit of a conflict between the system rules and their request. My best guess is to include both: using web.run citations along with markdown links for clarity.**Clarifying citation placement**

I need to clarify where to put citations based on the web.run rules, which say they should be placed after paragraphs. I’ll include both the web.run citation and markdown links at the end of each paragraph. Also, all internet-supportable statements should have citations, so I need to make sure to cite the five most critical ones. I plan to search for news on specific topics, like the current U.S. President and weather forecasts for Portland, Oregon.**Deciding on weather and date queries**

I’m looking into how to fetch weather information using the web.run weather tool specifically for Portland, OR starting tomorrow, September 15, 2025. Also, the user asked for today’s date. It’s September 14, 2025, but since I need to follow their request to search for everything online, I might consider checking the current date and time through the web.run time tool. However, I already know the date from the system context is correct, but I need to keep that system directive in mind.**Planning web queries**

I need to remember that when the user asks for something like "latest" or "today's," I shouldn't assume my knowledge is current. Instead, I must confirm the true latest information first. I’ll be using web.run for each inquiry. I plan to search for news about Charlie Kirk, the current President of the United States, and the weather for Portland, OR on September 15, 2025. For today's date, I may check sources like time.is or timeanddate.**Executing web queries and tools**

I’m planning to search for today’s date with a query like "what day is today, September 14, 2025?" I might use the web.run time tool for that, which accepts a UTC offset. Since Portland, OR is in Pacific Time (UTC-7 during DST in September), I can use "-07:00" for the offset to get the current time. I'll also create calls for news inquiries about Charlie Kirk and the current President of the United States, focusing on reliable sources like NYTimes or CNN. Finally, I'll fetch the weather for Portland, OR starting September 15, 2025.**Analyzing weather and date**

I’ve got good news from Reuters! For the weather, I used the tool to check Portland, OR, on September 15, 2025, which is forecasted to be mostly sunny with temperatures reaching 74°F. I need to cite the source for the weather information. I'll also summarize that tomorrow's weather expects highs around 74°F but note that forecasts can change. Now, I need to find out what day today is. Today is September 14, 2025, and I want to confirm it’s a Sunday.**Preparing source links**

I'll include markdown links to domain homepages instead of specific articles, so the user gets examples like [nytimes.com](https://nytimes.com/some-page). Sources I'll link to include reuters.com, whitehouse.gov, washingtonpost.com, and wikipedia.org. For weather, I can cite the tool reference and also link to weather.com or the National Weather Service. The weather tool is authoritative, but I can still run a quick search for the NWS forecast for Portland on September 15, 2025, to cite it.**Citing web search results**

The user requested that I cite all web search results. While it may seem unnecessary, I’ll ensure to include citations. I plan to cite the weather tool with the web.run forecast token and provide a markdown link to "weather.gov" for Portland. I'll run a search for the "NWS Portland Oregon forecast" for September 15, 2025, using the query "Portland OR weather.gov" to get accurate reference information.

Notes, cautions and next steps
- I ran fresh web searches for each question (per your files and instructions). For the Charlie Kirk situation the story is active and details (charges, motive, court filings, memorials) can change quickly — check trusted news outlets or official law‑enforcement releases if you want updates later today or tomorrow. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/charlie-kirk-shooting-suspect-not-cooperating-with-authorities-utah-governor-2025-09-14/))
- Weather forecasts are time‑sensitive; I cited both a direct forecast readout and the National Weather Service — refresh those sources the morning of Sep 15 if you need real‑time decisions. ([weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/pqr/?utm_source=openai))

If you want, I can:
- Watch the Charlie Kirk story and send a short update later today/tomorrow.  
- Pull a more detailed hour‑by‑hour Portland forecast for a specific ZIP code or neighborhood.  
- Pull official press releases (e.g., Utah Dept. of Public Safety, FBI, or local prosecutors) about the Kirk case and compile a timeline.
