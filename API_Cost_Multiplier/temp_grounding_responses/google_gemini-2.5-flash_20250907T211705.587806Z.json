            "text": "The U.S. Census Bureau has undergone significant changes in its structure, permanence, and scope since its inception:\n\n1.  **Early Ad Hoc Operations (1790-1902):**\n    *   **Constitutional Mandate:** The U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 2) mandated a decennial census for congressional apportionment, beginning in 1790.\n    *   **Temporary Offices:** For over a century, a temporary Census Office was established for each decennial count and then disbanded, with the work often overseen by various federal departments (e.g., State, Interior).\n\n2.  **Establishment as a Permanent Bureau (1902):**\n    *   **Permanent Status:** The Census Office became a permanent federal agency in **1902**, recognizing the need for continuous data collection and statistical expertise beyond just the decennial count. It was initially placed within the Department of the Interior.\n\n3.  **Departmental Shifts (1903-Present):**\n    *   **Commerce and Labor:** In **1903**, it moved to the newly created Department of Commerce and Labor.\n    *   **Department of Commerce:** When the Department of Commerce and Labor split in **1913**, the Census Bureau remained within the Department of Commerce, where it has been ever since.\n\n4.  **Expansion of Scope and Functions:**\n    *   **Beyond Population:** While initially focused on population, its mandate expanded to include detailed data on agriculture, manufacturing, mining, business, and housing.\n    *   **Ongoing Surveys:** It began conducting numerous intercensal and ongoing surveys (e.g., Current Population Survey, American Community Survey) to provide timely economic and social data.\n    *   **Statistical Innovation:** The Bureau became a leader in statistical methodology, including the development and application of sampling techniques in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n5.  **Technological Advancements:**\n    *   **Punch Cards:** For the 1890 census, Herman Hollerith's electric tabulating system using punch cards revolutionized data processing, dramatically speeding up results.\n    *   **Computers:** The Census Bureau was an early adopter of electronic computers, utilizing UNIVAC I for the 1950 census data processing.\n    *   **Digital Data & GIS:** It has increasingly leveraged digital data collection, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for mapping and data dissemination, and internet-based reporting.\n\nIn summary, the Census Bureau evolved from a temporary, decennial operation to a permanent, multi-faceted statistical agency, continually adapting its methods and expanding its scope to meet the nation's evolving data needs."
