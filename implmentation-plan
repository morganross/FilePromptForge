Plan explained in plain high-school language

Overview — what the program does
- You give the program two files: File A and File B.
- The program makes one prompt from those files.
- It sends that prompt to OpenAI’s Responses API (with web search turned on).
- It gets the reply and writes two files: a human-readable response and a raw JSON file with the full API output.
the keys for providers are in .env in the /filepromptforge/ root dir. load from there, and offer no other choices.


Step-by-step flow (easy words)

1) Start / CLI
- You run the program from the command line (or call run() from code).
- You can pass file paths or use the default test files that live in /test/.

2) Load secrets and configuration
- The program reads a small config file (YAML) to know:
  - Which model to use
  - The provider URL to call
  - Web search settings (like how many results)
  - A default test pair of files
- It also reads a .env file for the OpenAI API key. The key never gets written to disk.

3) Build the prompt
- The program reads the text of File A and File B.
- It plugs that text into a template that looks like:
  "File A: <name>\n<contents>\nFile B: <name>\n<contents>"
- This combined text is the prompt we send to the model.

4) Provider module (OpenAI only)
- There is one provider module for OpenAI. It knows:
  - How to build the exact JSON payload the OpenAI Responses API expects.
  - Which models are allowed (a whitelist).
  - How to pull readable text out of the API response.
- The provider module exposes three functions the router will call:
  - build_payload(prompt, cfg) -> payload (and optional headers)
  - parse_response(raw_json) -> readable_text
  - validate_model(model_id) -> bool

    The most important job of the provider modules,
    and the most important job of the entire fpf project, is that the provider modules translate the variables we have specifyed in fpf_config like 'tokens' and translates it into the syntax that the indivual provider perfers, like 'max_tokens" or 'max_completion_tokens" or whatever.




5) Router / file_handler
- The router (file_handler.py) is the central place that:
  - Calls compose_input to make the prompt
  - Calls provider.build_payload to get the request body
  - Adds the Authorization header from the environment
  - Sends ONE non-streaming HTTP POST to the provider_url
  - Receives JSON back from the API
  - Calls provider.parse_response to get human text
  - Writes two files:
    - <file_b>.fpf.response.txt (the human text)
    - <file_b>.fpf.response.txt.raw.json (full JSON)
- Overwrite is allowed: the program will replace existing output files.

6) Default test run
- If you run the program without specifying files, it will load the test pair listed in the YAML config (the files already in /test/).
- This gives a predictable demo run.

7) Error messages and safety
- If the API key is missing, the program prints a short error and exits.
- If the HTTP call fails, the program prints the returned error (status code and message).
- The API key is never logged or saved.

What I’ll change in the repo (concrete files)
- filepromptforge/file_handler.py
  - Make it the single router that performs the HTTP call and writes output.
  - It will import the provider module for OpenAI and call its functions.
- filepromptforge/fpf/fpf_main.py
  - Keep the compose_input and config loader functions available for import.
- filepromptforge/providers/openai/fpf_openai_main.py
  - Ensure it exposes build_payload, parse_response, validate_model.
  - Keep the model whitelist here.
- filepromptforge/fpf_config.yaml (or top-level fpf_config.yaml)
  - Make sure it contains test.file_a and test.file_b entries pointing at the /test/ files.

Why this design is good
- Clear separation: provider-specific details live in the provider file. Router does networking and file I/O only.
- Easy to change models: whitelist lives with the provider, so adding/removing models is simple.
- Simple behavior: program does one API call per run, so it’s easy to reason about and debug.
- Matches your rules: OpenAI only, non-streaming, web search enabled.

Small decisions I made for you
- Use the OpenAI Responses API shapes (model, input list, web_search key).
- Use a simple HTTP client (urllib) to avoid adding library dependencies.
- Write output files directly (overwrite allowed) since you said overwrite is fine.

Open question you already answered
- Provider target: OpenAI only (not OpenRouter) — implemented.
- Overwrite: allowed — implemented.
- Tests: use your default script behavior (no separate test framework) — implemented.

Next steps if you want me to implement this now
- Toggle to Act mode and I will:
  1) Normalize the provider module (add build_payload/parse_response/validate_model).
  2) Make file_handler the router that does the POST and file writes.
  3) Ensure compose_input and config are available and the YAML test entries are correct.
  4) Run a non-network dry-check (compose prompt from /test/ files) to confirm prompt building (no API call).
  5) If you want, run the real API call (requires OPENAI_API_KEY in environment).

If any part of this explanation is unclear, say which step and I’ll rephrase it even simpler.
