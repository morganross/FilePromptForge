{"candidates": [{"content": {"parts": [{"text": "Yes, the Texas Democrats who left the state in 2021 have returned.\n\n**Why they left:**\nThey left Texas in July 2021 to Washington D.C. to break quorum in the Texas House of Representatives. Their goal was to prevent the Republican-controlled legislature from passing a controversial bill (Senate Bill 1) that would enact new, restrictive voting laws in the state. By leaving, they made it impossible for the House to have enough members present to conduct business, effectively stalling the bill.\n\n**What happened when they returned:**\nThe Democrats eventually returned to Texas in August 2021, as their strategy of breaking quorum could not be sustained indefinitely and the special legislative session was nearing its end. Upon their return, the House reconvened.\n\n**What the GOP did:**\nThe Republican leadership, including Governor Greg Abbott, called for special legislative sessions to ensure the voting bill would eventually pass. They also sought to compel the Democrats' return, threatening them with arrest and fines for breaking quorum.\n\n**How they (Democrats) responded:**\nDespite their efforts, the Democrats were ultimately unable to prevent the bill's passage. Once quorum was re-established, the Republican majority proceeded to pass Senate Bill 1, which Governor Abbott signed into law in September 2021. The Democrats continued to criticize the law, arguing it would suppress voter turnout, particularly among minority groups."}], "role": "model"}, "finishReason": "STOP", "index": 0}], "usageMetadata": {"promptTokenCount": 57, "candidatesTokenCount": 292, "totalTokenCount": 518, "promptTokensDetails": [{"modality": "TEXT", "tokenCount": 57}], "thoughtsTokenCount": 169}, "modelVersion": "gemini-2.5-flash", "responseId": "M06uaPLLKfStz7IPz6OamAo"}
