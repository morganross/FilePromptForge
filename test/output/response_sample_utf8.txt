Yes, the Texas Democrats have returned to the state. In early August 2025, over 50 Democratic lawmakers left Texas to prevent a quorum in the House, aiming to block a Republican-backed redistricting plan that would add five GOP-leaning congressional seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. They traveled to states like Illinois and New York to stall the vote and advocate for federal intervention.

Upon their return, the Texas House regained the quorum necessary to proceed with legislative business. The Democrats' absence had temporarily halted the redistricting plan, but their return allowed the process to resume. Republican leaders, including Governor Greg Abbott, responded by issuing civil arrest warrants and threatening fines to compel the Democrats' attendance. However, legal jurisdiction issues limited enforcement actions against those who had left the state.

The Democrats' strategy drew national attention, with support from Democratic governors like J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Kathy Hochul of New York, who criticized the redistricting efforts as gerrymandering. Despite the Democrats' efforts, the redistricting plan ultimately moved forward upon their return.
